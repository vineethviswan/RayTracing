Ray Tracing Implementation in C++

Welcome to the Ray Tracing project! This repository contains an implementation of the Ray Tracing algorithm based on the book "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" by Peter Shirley. 
The project is developed in C++ and utilizes DirectX 11 for image rendering and ImGui for the windowing and UI framework.
