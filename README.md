## What It Does

This ray tracer renders photorealistic 3D scenes using physically-based ray tracing algorithms. Users can interactively adjust camera parameters, scene objects, and rendering settings while seeing the results update in real-time. The application provides a complete development environment for experimenting with ray tracing techniques, from basic sphere rendering to advanced material systems and lighting models.

The ray tracer generates images by simulating the path of light rays through a 3D scene, calculating realistic reflections, shadows, and material interactions. The rendered output is displayed both as a full-screen view and within the UI for detailed inspection and comparison.

## Development Approach

### Phased Development Strategy
The project follows a carefully planned six-phase development approach, ensuring each component is thoroughly tested before building upon it:

**Phase 1: Foundation & Framework** - Establish core application architecture, window management, and basic DirectX integration with a functioning layer system.

**Phase 2: UI Integration** - Complete ImGui integration with DirectX 11, implement docking system, and create the foundational user interface with responsive controls.

**Phase 3: Image Pipeline** - Develop the image buffer management system, GPU texture synchronization, and display pipeline for real-time image updates.

**Phase 4: Camera & Mathematics** - Implement camera system with ray generation, vector mathematics library, and interactive camera controls.

**Phase 5: Ray Tracing Core** - Build the fundamental ray tracing engine with scene objects, basic lighting, and material interactions.

**Phase 6: Advanced Features** - Add sophisticated materials, multi-threading support, performance optimizations, and advanced UI controls.

### Architecture Philosophy
The project emphasizes **separation of concerns** through a layer-based architecture where each component has clearly defined responsibilities. The UI layer handles user interaction and interface rendering, while the ray tracing layer manages scene data and rendering operations. This separation enables independent development, testing, and maintenance of different system components.

The design prioritizes **extensibility** and **maintainability**, using established design patterns like Strategy, Facade, and Observer to create flexible interfaces. This approach allows for easy addition of new rendering techniques, material types, and UI features without disrupting existing functionality.

### Performance Considerations
From the outset, the architecture is designed for **high performance** with multi-threaded rendering, efficient memory management, and optimized data structures. The system uses tile-based rendering to maximize CPU utilization while maintaining responsive UI interaction through careful thread coordination.

## Testing Strategy

### Comprehensive Validation Approach
Each development phase includes specific testing requirements and success criteria, ensuring system reliability and performance. The testing strategy encompasses unit testing, integration testing, and performance benchmarking.

**Unit Testing** focuses on individual components like vector mathematics, camera ray generation, and image buffer operations. Each mathematical operation and core algorithm is validated with comprehensive test cases covering edge conditions and numerical stability.

**Integration Testing** verifies proper interaction between major system components, including the camera-to-image pipeline, UI-to-rendering communication, and DirectX resource management. These tests ensure that component interfaces work correctly together.

**Performance Testing** establishes benchmarks for rendering speed, memory usage, and multi-threading efficiency. Regular performance validation ensures that optimizations maintain system responsiveness while delivering quality improvements.

### Incremental Validation
The phased development approach enables **incremental validation**, where each phase must meet specific criteria before proceeding. This includes functional requirements (does it work correctly?), performance requirements (does it meet speed targets?), and usability requirements (is the interface responsive?).

Each phase produces a **working application** that can be demonstrated and evaluated, providing early feedback on architectural decisions and implementation quality. This approach reduces integration risk and ensures steady progress toward project goals.
